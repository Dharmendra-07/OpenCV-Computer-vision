#Computer Vision Projects with OpenCV

This repository contains multiple mini-projects showcasing different Computer Vision techniques using Python and OpenCV. Each project demonstrates how to process, analyze, and manipulate images and videos.

📂 Projects Overview

1. Image Drawing Functions
	•	Drawing shapes, lines, and adding text to images.
	•	Example: Writing “Hello Python Programmers” on an image.

2. Filtering & Blurring
	•	Applying filters like Gaussian Blur, sharpening, and smoothing.
	•	Example: Enhancing image quality and removing noise.

3. Edge Detection
	•	Detecting object boundaries using Canny Edge Detection and thresholding.
	•	Example: Highlighting outlines of shapes and objects in an image.

4. Contour & Shape Detection
	•	Detecting geometric shapes (circles, triangles, etc.) from images.
	•	Example: Identifying and labeling shapes in input images.

5. Face & Object Detection
	•	Using Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces, eyes, and smiles.
	•	Example: Real-time face and eye detection via webcam.

6. Video Processing
	•	Capturing live video, saving recordings, and applying effects in real-time.
	•	Example: Creating and saving .avi video files with OpenCV.
