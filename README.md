🖼️ Computer Vision Projects with OpenCV

This repository contains multiple mini-projects showcasing different Computer Vision techniques using Python and OpenCV. Each project demonstrates how to process, analyze, and manipulate images and videos.

📂 Projects Overview

1. Image Drawing Functions
	•	Drawing shapes, lines, and adding text to images.
	•	Example: Writing “Hello Python Programmers” on an image.

2. Filtering & Blurring
	•	Applying filters like Gaussian Blur, sharpening, and smoothing.
	•	Example: Enhancing image quality and removing noise.

3. Edge Detection
	•	Detecting object boundaries using Canny Edge Detection and thresholding.
	•	Example: Highlighting outlines of shapes and objects in an image.

4. Contour & Shape Detection
	•	Detecting geometric shapes (circles, triangles, etc.) from images.
	•	Example: Identifying and labeling shapes in input images.

5. Face & Object Detection
	•	Using Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces, eyes, and smiles.
	•	Example: Real-time face and eye detection via webcam.

6. Video Processing
	•	Capturing live video, saving recordings, and applying effects in real-time.
	•	Example: Creating and saving .avi video files with OpenCV.

👉 This description will look great in your README.md and also help you explain your projects in interviews.

Do you want me to make this short for GitHub (1–2 lines per project) or a detailed version with images/code snippets?
